# NLP_Project
• Utilized re3d dataset in CoNLL format. Employed visualization tools (dashboards, word clouds) to analyze word and 
tag distribution for each entity.
• Performed cleanup of Arabic characters using utf-8 encoding. Ensured dataset integrity before model development.
• Constructed BiLSTM architecture with pre-trained glove embeddings.
• Implemented categorical cross-entropy loss and softmax activation functions using TensorFlow in Python with the 
Keras framework, achieving 89% validation accuracy for training, 83% for testing, and 84% for validation sets.
